![perl](phlpm_logo.png)

Once a month, we meet and someone gives a presentation about technical issues about Perl, or the world surrounding Perl. Past talks include JSON, PerlÂ 6, Perl in the real world, Regular Expressions, and more. Generally our speakers come from within phl.pm, but from time to time we bring in a guru from elsewhere in the Perl community.

# Mailing list
We have a rather low-volume [mailing list](http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/philadelphia-pm), used mostly for negotiation of meeting locations and occasional technical chatter.

# Calendar

Can we even do this?
